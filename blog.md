# Bussiness Analysis with Statistical Testing

The goal of this project is to do statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to generate valuable analytical insights for the company.  In this I will share one A/B test with you a one question. The question is **where and when Northwind company should start offering a new line of cheese.**
 

## Dataset:
Nortwind Dataset

## Metodology:

- Scientific Method 
- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

The general structure of an experiment is as follows:

1. Make an Observation and Come up with the Question

The first step of the scientific method is to observe something that you want to test. 

2. Examine the Data

In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task. The main pillars of EDA are data cleaning, data preparation, data exploration, and data visualization. 

3. Form a Hypothesis

During this stage, you'll formulate 2 hypotheses to test--your educated guess about the outcome is called the Alternative Hypothesis, while the opposite of it is called the Null Hypothesis.

4. Run the Test

This step is the part of the scientific method that will be the focus of this section. You must pick the right test for you case. Moreover, each staistical test has a set of assumptions to be considered accurate. Make sure those assumptions are met and run the test.

5. Analyze Experimental Results

During this step, you will tease out relationships, filter out noise, and try to determine if something that happened is statistically significant or not. Depend on the test result, you will compare t,f,z, mostly p value with the alpha value to come up with conclusions.

6. Draw Conclusions

You've asked a question, looked at experimental results from others that could be related to your question, made an educated guess, designed an experiment, collected data and analyzed the results. The reality of this step is that you use your analysis of the data to do one of two things: either reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject the null hypothesis.

## Bussines Problem

Where and when should Northwind company start offering a new line of cheese?
To be able answer explore the answer to this question we need to ask another question. **Does the revenue of dairy product (cheese) differs by any combination of region and the time of the years?** The answer is yes or no. We can figure this by A/B yesting. 

The data is in a SQL database. There are several ways to retreive data from such database. You can load all of the data in to dataframe at once and deal within just Python. But I will only query the data parts that I will use as a good practice of reducing the load for the processor. Since SQL is a lot faster than Pyhton in data processing, I also will do filtering and extracting data in SQL query as much as I can.

### Loading Data

I will create an engine to connect to SQL Database and send quesries as I needed.

#### Creating engine to connect to Database and send queries 

```python
# connecting to the Database using SQLAlchemy
engine = create_engine("sqlite:///Northwind_small.sqlite")
‚Äã
# create an inspector object
inspector = inspect(engine)
‚Äã
# get names of tables in database
print(inspector.get_table_names())
['Category', 'Customer', 'CustomerCustomerDemo', 'CustomerDemographic', 'Employee', 'EmployeeTerritory', 'Order', 'OrderDetail', 'Product', 'Region', 'Shipper', 'Supplier', 'Territory']
# write a quick function that prints the columns of a table and each column's type
‚Äã
def get_columns_info(table_name):    
    """ Function takes in table name and prints columns' names
    and datatypes """
    
    cols_list = inspector.get_columns(table_name)    
    print(f"Table Name: {table_name}\n")
    for col in cols_list:
        print(f"Name: {col['name']} \t Type: {col['type']}")
# calling the function to test it
get_columns_info('OrderDetail')
```

I will need from a few tables and do some feature engineering to calculate revenue.
```python
get_columns_info('Category')
```
```
Table Name: Category

Name: Id 	 Type: INTEGER
Name: CategoryName 	 Type: VARCHAR(8000)
Name: Description 	 Type: VARCHAR(8000)
```
```python
data1 = pd.read_sql_query('''
                            SELECT   *
                            FROM Category
                            
                            ;''', engine)
```

I will only select the dairy product for cheeses, calculate and select the revenue, region and month of the order from data. To be able to get the month information, I need to select the month info as a substring from the orderdate column because it is all VARCHAR format.

```python
data = pd.read_sql_query('''
                            SELECT   
                                ((od.Quantity * od.UnitPrice)* (1-od.Discount)) as Revenue , c.Region, od.Quantity,
                                SUBSTR(o.OrderDate, 6, 2) OrderMonth 
                            FROM Product p 
                            JOIN OrderDetail od ON p.Id =od.ProductId
                            JOIN [Order] o ON od.OrderId = o.Id
                            JOIN Customer c ON o.CustomerId = c.Id
‚Äã
                            WHERE p.CategoryId=4 
                        ;''', engine)
‚Äã
```
```python
byregion=data.groupby(['Region']).sum()
```
```python
ax1 = byregion.plot.barh( y='Revenue', rot=0)
ax2 = byregion.plot.barh( y='Quantity', rot=0)
```
![img](https://github.com/fcamuz/bussines-analysis-with-statistical-testing/blob/master/images/img1.png)

```python
bymonth=data.groupby(['OrderMonth']).sum()
ax2 = bymonth.plot.bar( y='Quantity', rot=0 )
```

### 4.3 Hypothesis

Main effect of factor A ("Order Region"):

ùêª0: The average revenue in an order for dairy products are equal for all regions. 

ùêª1: The average revenue in an order for dairy products are different at least for one region.

Main effect of factor B ("Order Month"):

ùêª0: The average revenue for in an order dairy products are equal for all months of a year. ùêª1: The average revenue for in an order dairy products are different at least for one month of the year.

Factor A x factor B interactions:

ùêª0: There is no interaction between "Order Region" and "Order Month". ùêª1: There is an interaction between "Order Region" and "Order Month".

I set my significance level (Alpha): 0.05
ùõº = 0.05

### 4.4 Statistical Analysis

The two-way ANOVA examines the effect of two factors (month and region) on a dependent variable ‚Äì in this case revenue, and also examines whether the two factors affect each other to influence the continuous variable.

#### ANOVA Assumptions

* Each group sample is drawn from a normally distributed population
* All populations have a common variance
* All samples are drawn independently of each other
* Within each sample, the observations are sampled randomly and independently of each other
* Factor effects are additive
* Dependent variable should be continuous 
* Independent variables should be in categorical, independent groups

The presence of outliers can also cause problems. In addition, we need to make sure that the F statistic is well behaved. In particular, the F statistic is relatively robust to violations of normality provided:

* The populations are symmetrical and uni-modal.
* The sample sizes for the groups are equal and greater than 10

In general, as long as the sample sizes are equal (called a balanced model) and sufficiently large, the normality assumption can be violated provided the samples are symmetrical or at least similar in shape (e.g. all are negatively skewed).


#### Normality Check

```python
#KS-Test for checking normality
stats.kstest(data.Revenue, 'norm', args=(0,2))

KstestResult(statistic=0.9999893114742251, pvalue=0.0)
```
p_value is 0, so we can not say that the distribution is normal however when the sample size is sufficiently large, Anova can still perform well.
#### Equal Variances Check

```python
stats.levene(data['Revenue'][data['Region'] == "Western Europe"],
             data['Revenue'][data['Region'] == "South America"],
             data['Revenue'][data['Region'] == "Scandinavia"],
             data['Revenue'][data['Region'] == "North America"],
             data['Revenue'][data['Region'] == "Southern Europe"],
             data['Revenue'][data['Region'] == "Northern Europe"],
             data['Revenue'][data['Region'] == "British Isles"],
             data['Revenue'][data['Region'] == "Central America"],
             data['Revenue'][data['Region'] == "Eastern Europe"]
            )
LeveneResult(statistic=1.7172829986494036, pvalue=0.0932244407555185)
stats.levene(data['Revenue'][data['OrderMonth'] == "01"],
             data['Revenue'][data['OrderMonth'] == "02"],
             data['Revenue'][data['OrderMonth'] == "03"],
             data['Revenue'][data['OrderMonth'] == "04"],
             data['Revenue'][data['OrderMonth'] == "05"],
             data['Revenue'][data['OrderMonth'] == "06"],
             data['Revenue'][data['OrderMonth'] == "07"],
             data['Revenue'][data['OrderMonth'] == "08"],
             data['Revenue'][data['OrderMonth'] == "09"],
             data['Revenue'][data['OrderMonth'] == "10"],
             data['Revenue'][data['OrderMonth'] == "11"],
             data['Revenue'][data['OrderMonth'] == "12"]
            )
LeveneResult(statistic=1.6804048575969928, pvalue=0.07632782503794072)
```

#### Performing two-way ANOVA Test

```python
formula = 'Revenue ~ C(Region)*C(OrderMonth)'
lm2 = ols(formula, data).fit()
table = sm.stats.anova_lm(lm2, typ=2)
print(table)
‚Äã
                               sum_sq     df         F    PR(>F)
C(Region)                3.899516e+06    8.0  1.223844  0.289722
C(OrderMonth)            3.794354e+05   11.0  0.086607  0.999906
C(Region):C(OrderMonth)  1.961990e+07   88.0  0.559783  0.997149
Residual                 1.059440e+08  266.0       NaN       NaN
```

You may check the OLS Regression Results and summary with summary() method.
```python
lm2.summary()
```

By looking at the p value, we fail to reject null hypothesis for factor A ,C and Factor A and B interaction. That mean we can suggest that the average revenue for dairy products are not significantly different at anytime of the year and at any region. However, we can still look at those categories to see the small differences.

There are a few different methods of post-hoc testing to find a difference between groups of factors. I will use Tukey‚Äôs HSD from 2 different libraries. It basically compares each pair combination available in a group.

```python
from statsmodels.stats.multicomp import pairwise_tukeyhsd
‚Äã
tukey = pairwise_tukeyhsd(endog=data.Revenue,     # Data
                          groups=data.OrderMonth,   # Groups
                          alpha=0.05)          # Significance level
‚Äã
tukey.plot_simultaneous()  

tukey.summary() 
```
```

As it shows in the reject column, non of those pairs are significantly different from each other in termes of mean revenue. However, you can see the small monthly flactuations from the plot.

Another way of doing this tst is directly through the statsmodels.stats.multicomp library. This time we can see the plots showing the confedence level of each group individually.

```python
import statsmodels.stats.multicomp 
# for comparing the product categories, we use visualizations
posthoc = statsmodels.stats.multicomp.MultiComparison(data['Revenue'], data['Region'])
posthoc_results = posthoc.tukeyhsd()
print('\n', posthoc_results)‚Äã
```
![img](https://github.com/fcamuz/bussines-analysis-with-statistical-testing/blob/master/images/img4.png)

```python
posthoc_results
```
```
<statsmodels.sandbox.stats.multicomp.TukeyHSDResults at 0x1c28950c18>
```
```python
regions=data.Region.unique()
```
```python
for i in regions:
    posthoc_results.plot_simultaneous(comparison_name=i, figsize=(6,4));
```

## Conclusion

According to ANOVA tests result, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. So, neither region nor the time of the year does not effect the average revanue from dairy product significantly.

That would mean Cheese is a timeless product. It can be sold anywhere and anytime.
The company can invest on advertising so that it attracts more customer without worrying about the season and location.

Western Europe region had the most number of orders and the largest revenue.
Eastern Europe region are lowest on cheese sale.
The largest volume of cheese sale happens in January


Company sells cheese in 8 regions year round. I have run two-way ANOVA test to see if there is any difference of the cheese sale in between regions. Also tested the months of the year if there is any significant increase or decrease on the sales. Also tested if there is any best combination of the time of the year and the region. Test results suggest that no significant difference between any of the region nor time of the year for cheese sales. However, largest volume of the cheese sale happens in the Western Europe and overall cheese sales are highest in the month of January. 

## Based on A/B testing and data, my suggestion is Northwind Company would advertise and kick-off the sale of the new line of cheese in January in Western Europe region.
